# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Welcome, Future Contributors!

We are thrilled that you're interested in contributing to the **Data Structures and Algorithms in Go** repository! Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone with a passion for Go, we welcome you with open arms and a friendly smile.

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of making our community a welcoming and inclusive place, we as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to:
- Be kind and respectful to everyone
- Create a safe and friendly environment for learning and collaboration
- Celebrate the diversity of ideas, perspectives, and experiences

## Our Standards

To keep things fun and friendly, here are some examples of awesome behavior:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language (no jargon or tech-snobbery here!)
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences (because everyone’s got their own cool way of thinking)
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback (we all grow together)
- Focusing on what’s best for the community (teamwork makes the dream work)
- Showing empathy and kindness (because everyone has those days)

And here are a few behaviors that aren’t as awesome and should be avoided:

- Using sexualized language or imagery (keep it classy)
- Making unwelcome comments or personal attacks (let’s keep it friendly)
- Public or private harassment (not cool in any universe)
- Publishing others' private information without permission (privacy matters)
- Any conduct that would make someone feel uncomfortable or unwelcome

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are here to help and ensure that our community remains a welcoming place. They’ll clarify and enforce our standards, and they have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that aren’t in line with this Code of Conduct. Don’t worry; they’ll always try to be fair and explain their decisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces and public spaces where someone is representing the project. This includes using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project team at [your-email@example.com](mailto:your-email@example.com). We promise to review and investigate all complaints promptly and fairly, and we’ll keep everything as confidential as possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

To keep things light and positive, we’ll handle issues with a focus on education and resolution. Here’s how we approach it:

### 1. Gentle Reminder

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unwelcoming behavior.

**Consequence**: A friendly reminder to keep things positive and inclusive. We all have off days, and a gentle nudge is usually all it takes.

### 2. Formal Warning

**Community Impact**: A repeated issue or a single serious incident.

**Consequence**: A more formal warning with a request to adjust behavior. Think of it as a time-out to reflect on how to be a better community member.

### 3. Temporary Cool-off

**Community Impact**: Continuing problems or a significant breach of community standards.

**Consequence**: A temporary suspension from community activities to cool off and reconsider actions. We all need a break sometimes.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: A severe breach of community standards or a pattern of harmful behavior.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from the community to ensure the safety and well-being of others. This is a last resort, but sometimes necessary for the greater good.
