## Introduction

Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning data structures and algorithms in Go, aimed at both beginners and advanced programmers.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install) to install Go.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-go.git

# Change directory
cd data-structures-go

# Run a sample program
go run basic/hello_world.go
